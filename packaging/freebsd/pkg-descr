YORI (Your Oversight for Responsible Intelligence) is a zero-trust LLM governance
proxy designed for home networks running on OPNsense routers.

It provides transparent interception and policy-based enforcement of LLM API
traffic (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) with features specifically designed for
family safety:

- Device allowlists and time-based exceptions
- Parental controls (homework hours, bedtime blocking)
- Emergency override mechanisms
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Web UI integration with OPNsense

YORI uses SARK (Secure Autonomous Runtime for Kubernetes) components for
high-performance policy evaluation and caching.
