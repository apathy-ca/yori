comment: YORI - Zero-trust LLM governance for home networks
desc: |
  YORI provides transparent interception and policy-based governance of LLM API
  traffic on home networks. It acts as a proxy between your devices and LLM
  services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), enabling visibility, audit logging,
  and policy enforcement for AI interactions.

  Features:
  - Transparent proxy for major LLM APIs
  - Three operation modes: observe, advisory, enforce
  - SQLite-based audit logging with retention policies
  - OPA (Open Policy Agent) policy engine integration
  - Web UI for service management and configuration
  - Real-time service status monitoring
